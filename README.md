This project is one from YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDa8kZLNhJ4) which I am following 
in order to do the following: 

  - Web Development in React/Next.js 💻
  - Practice JavaScript, JSX (HTML/CSS) and performing API calls using Node.js 👨‍💻
  - Understand the design process of web applications in order to create my own in the future 🧠
  - Learn how to use developer tools like VSCode more efficiently as well as some niche tricks 😎
  
  I plan to use this to create my own applications in the future!!!
